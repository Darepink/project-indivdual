(2) General and specific inquires

I want to answer General Question 1: what player characteristics and behaviours predict subscribing to the game related newsletter?

My questions is: Can player experience level, total time spent on the server, age, and gender predict whether a player subscribes to the Minecraft research newsletter? 

The response variable is `subscribe` (TRUE/FALSE) from `players.csv`. The explanatory variables will include `experience`, `played_hours`, `Age`, and `gender` to start. 
For this individual stage I will stick to mainly working with `players.csv`, I may integrate some session based behaviour predictors at a later stage.
