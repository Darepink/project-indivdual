(4) Methods and plan

Since the outcome is binary, I will leverage logistic regression to estimate subscription to a newsletter.
This will allow me to model the probability of `subscribe = TRUE` from features describing the players and yields an easy to interpret odds ratios.

Some key assumptions are having independent observations, a reasonable functional form for the numeric predictors (specifically, I will assume roughly linear effects of both `Age` and `played_hours` on the log-odds), and not having extreme multicollinearity issues.
There are limitations associated with logistic regression, such as sensitivity to outliers and that the linear decision boundary does not account for more complex nonlinear interactions.

For this analysis, I will randomly split the data into a training set (70%) and a held-out test set (30%).
The split will be stratified by `subscribe` to ensure that the training data maintains the overall rate of subscriptions.
On the training set, I will utilize a k-fold cross-validation scheme to evaluate models (e.g. with or without `gender` as a predictor, or transformed `played_hours`) based on the metrics of accuracy and AUC, and later evaluate the final selected model once on the held-out test set.
